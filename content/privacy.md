### Disclaimer

I am not a website expert by any means. From my perspective, internet
technology is a giant spaghetti monster rivaling the worst code bases
imaginable. I find it a miracle it actually works. 

Thus, all things below should be interpreted as being to the best of my
knowledge.

### So why do I use cookies?

I use Google Analytics on this site so that I can keep count of how many people
view the site and how popular specific pages are. Google Analytics does _not_
track your browsing history outside of this website.

To do this, Google uses cookies. Via Hugo settings (from which this website is
built), I've:

- Enabled anonymizing the IP addresses of users
- Enabled respect of HTTP Do Not Track headers

If you have any questions regarding cookies or what they are, see [this
website](https://www.cookiesandyou.com/) for more information.
