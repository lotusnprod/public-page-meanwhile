title: "Toward Open Science in Natural Products Research: Curation and
  Dissemination of Natural Products Data in Wikidata"
  
abstract: As contemporary bioinformatic and chemoinformatic capabilities are
  reshaping natural products research, major benefits could result from an open
  database of structure-organism pairs. Those pairs allow the identification of
  distinct molecular structures found as components of heterogeneous chemical
  matrices originating from living organisms. Current databases with such
  information suffer from paywall restrictions, limited taxonomic scope, poorly
  standardized fields, and lack of interoperability. To ensure data quality,
  references to the work that describes the structure-organism relationship is
  mandatory. To fill this void, we collected and curated a set of
  structure-organism pairs from publicly available natural products databases to
  yield LOTUS (naturaL prOducTs occUrrences databaSe), which contains over
  500,000 curated and referenced structure-organism pairs. We make all scripts
  used for data collection, curation, and dissemination available. Aimed at
  providing unlimited access as well as standardized linkage to data from other
  resources, the extracted information is hosted on Wikidata. The diffusion of
  these referenced structure-organism pairs on the Wikidata framework addresses
  many of the limitations of currently-available databases and facilitates
  linkage to existing biological and chemical data resources. Collectively, this
  resource represents an important advancement in the design and deployment of a
  comprehensive and collaborative natural products knowledge base.
