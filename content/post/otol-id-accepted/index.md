After a short time and a proposal by Adriano (see how to link people here), a new property, Open Tree of Life ID (P9157), has been acepted on Wikidata. ðŸ”¥

<!--more-->

It represents an identifier for an entity in Open Tree of Life, a comprehensive, dynamic and digitally-available tree of life by synthesizing published phylogenetic trees along with taxonomic data. 

See here for more details https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Property:P9157
